# AlgoDat-tasks
This repo contains three bonus tasks from the course AlgoDat. The course was mainly theoretical, with most problems solved by hand. After each exam, students could earn bonus points by independently completing three algorithmic tasks and discussing their solutions. I solved the final three out of six tasks.
